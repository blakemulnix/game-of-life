# Conway's Game of Life

This is a project I am working on to learn React. Specifically I am trying to learn how to structure components, manage state effectively, and use React hooks within functional components.

This application is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
